# Android-native-examples
This project shows how to integrate C source code on an Android App using JNI (Java Native Interface).

In this case, I have implemented Fibonacci's and Factorial algorithms (Recursive and Iterative versions) using pure java and and C code in order to compare their performance. After several executions, it's posible to observe how the native alternative performs better (takes less time to finish the computation).


Based on the great tutorial on Android NDK by Aleksandar Gargenta (http://youtu.be/YvCRlJToCAg?list=PL0C9C46CAAB1CFB2B)
